## ***Challenge Overview***

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks, a data scientist received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received various amounts of funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.
Using my knowledge of machine learning and neural network model building, the team has asked me to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether or not an applicant will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup using the features collected in the provided dataset.

  * Import, analyze, clean, and preprocess a “real-world” classification dataset.
  * Select, design, and train a binary classification model of your choosing.
  * Optimize model training and input data to achieve desired model performance.
